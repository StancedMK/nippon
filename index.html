            <a id="shop">Japan</a> comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000 km northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea. The county's five main islands, from north to south, are
            Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese
            archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 sq-km. Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751 km). Because of its many far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world,
            covering 4,470,000 sq-km. About 73 percent of <a id="shop">Japan</a> is forested, mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population
            densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries. Approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International
            Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise and Wakayama Marina City.

            Japan has invested heavily in <a id="transport">transportation</a> infrastructure. The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers of prefectural
            roads, 54,736 kilometers of general national highways and 7641 kilometers of national expressways. Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese <a id="transport">railway</a> companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation
            markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality. There are 175 airports in
            Japan. The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, is Asia's second-busiest airport. The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively.
